Python library and design files for a modular greenhouse system based on the RaspberryPi

# Sensors

Connect a 3 Wire temperature/humidity sensor and up to 4 I2C sensors to monitor your plants.

# Hardware

You can find the schematic design file in the "hardware" section of this repo.

## Maximum Ratings
The HAT is designed to work with a single power supply, that backpowers the raspberry pi.
The power ratings for the supply are: 12V/2A 

# Coming Soon - PlantHAT Web-APP

I am working on a python web app based on flask to monitor the plants and provide a admin panel to control water pumps and different inductive loads needed for a garden/greenhouse.
Here is a screenshot of the current app:
